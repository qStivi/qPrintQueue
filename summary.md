# qPrintQueue Project Setup Summary

## Work Completed

1. **Reviewed and Updated .gitignore Files**
   - Examined the main .gitignore file for Flutter/Dart projects
   - Enhanced the API-specific .gitignore file to exclude:
     - Coverage reports
     - Database files (*.sqlite, *.db)
     - Build files

2. **Git Repository Setup**
   - Initialized a git repository in the project root
   - Created an initial commit with all project files
   - Excluded database files from version control
   - Added a remote origin pointing to GitHub

3. **Documentation**
   - Reviewed the existing README.md file
   - Created detailed instructions for setting up the GitHub repository
   - Prepared this summary of the work done

4. **Implemented Client-Server Architecture**
   - Updated the API server to bind to all network interfaces (0.0.0.0)
   - Added CORS middleware to allow cross-origin requests from web browsers
   - Implemented mDNS service discovery for automatic server discovery on local networks
   - Created a server discovery service in the Flutter app to find API servers
   - Added support for custom server URLs for remote access

5. **Enhanced User Experience**
   - Added a refresh button to the app bar for manual refresh
   - Implemented pull-to-refresh functionality for a more intuitive mobile experience
   - Created a settings screen for server configuration
   - Added automatic server discovery to simplify setup on local networks

## Next Steps

1. **Create GitHub Repository**
   - Follow the instructions in instructions.md to create a GitHub repository named "qPrintQueue"
   - Push the local repository to GitHub

2. **Project Development**
   - Add more robust error handling for network operations
   - Implement caching for offline operation
   - Add support for multiple server profiles
   - Enhance the UI with animations and transitions

## Project Structure

- `/lib`: Flutter application code
  - `/src/models`: Data models for print jobs
  - `/src/services`: API, authentication, and server discovery services
  - `/src/providers`: State management with Riverpod
  - `/src/screens`: UI screens including settings and job management
  - `/src/widgets`: Reusable UI components
- `/api`: Dart API backend with network interface discovery
- `/test`: Test files

## Using the New Features

1. **Server Configuration**
   - The API server now displays all available IP addresses on startup
   - Due to package limitations, automatic mDNS service advertisement is not available
   - The Flutter app prioritizes custom server URLs and localhost over network discovery

2. **Custom Server Configuration**
   - Access the settings screen by tapping the settings icon in the app bar
   - Enter a custom server URL for remote access (e.g., over the internet)
   - Select from discovered servers on the local network
   - Clear custom settings to return to automatic discovery

3. **Refresh Functionality**
   - Pull down on the job list to refresh (pull-to-refresh)
   - Tap the refresh icon in the app bar for manual refresh
   - Job list automatically refreshes after adding, editing, or deleting jobs

The project is now a fully-featured 3D print queue management application with a client-server architecture. The Flutter frontend can run on macOS, iOS, Android, and Web, connecting to a Dart API backend that can be discovered automatically on the local network or accessed remotely via a custom URL.
